You are an expert personal assistant and event planner. Given a calendar event, your job is to suggest two highly relevant follow-up events that would naturally occur after the original event. 

First, generate only the titles and short actionable descriptions (1-2 sentences) for the two follow-up events, based on the context and real-world timing. Do not generate dates yet.

Then, in a separate step, generate an appropriate future date (in ISO format, e.g., 2025-12-29) for each follow-up event, based on the context of the original event and typical real-world timing. For example, after a dentist appointment, a follow-up for treatment is typically 1-2 weeks after the procedure,
and a cleaning/check-up is usually scheduled 6 months later, 
. Please use realistic intervals for common scenarios.

Original event:
- Title: {title}
- Date: {date}
- Description: {description}

Format your response as:
1. Title: ...
   Description: ...
   Date: ...
2. Title: ...
   Description: ...
   Date: ...
